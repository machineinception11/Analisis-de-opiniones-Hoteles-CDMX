575,"Just spent a week at the Gran Hotel in a room facing the Zocalo, and thought it was fantastic. There are the obvious benefits of an A+ location and beautiful historic building. When you first arrive, the bellman will take you up in one of the vintage elevators and tell you about the hotel's history. (There's a set of modern elevators for regular use.) I was especially impressed with the welcoming and helpful staff. As someone who doesn't speak Spanish, I was grateful for a front desk staff who were fluent in English. My room was large and comfortable, and had blackout curtains that kept most light out. A nice touch was plenty of free bottled water and apples on the table right outside my door. A few notes: -There's a flight of stairs up from the street to the lobby. A doorman helps with bags. -The windows are double-pane and effective, but don't block all noise. And there's always something happening in the square. Protests, marches, performances, etc. Also, the twice-daily ceremony of soldiers marching out with music to raise the flag at 8 and lower it at 6. During the day, buskers perform below the rooms facing the side street. Taking it all in added to my experience. But if you need absolute silence, this isn't it. -The general location isn't ideal for Ubering to other parts of the city. Rides are cheap -- usually $4 to $6 to Polanco or Roma. But getting in and out of the narrow, one-way streets of the Centro can add a fair bit of time to the journey.",2019,5,1

585,"Just spent a week at the Gran Hotel in a room facing the Zocalo, and thought it was fantastic. There are the obvious benefits of an A+ location and beautiful historic building. When you first arrive, the bellman will take you up in one of the vintage elevators and tell you about the hotel's history. (There's a set of modern elevators for regular use.) I was especially impressed with the welcoming and helpful staff. As someone who doesn't speak Spanish, I was grateful for a front desk staff who were fluent in English. My room was large and comfortable, and had blackout curtains that kept most light out. A nice touch was plenty of free bottled water and apples on the table right outside my door. A few notes: -There's a flight of stairs up from the street to the lobby. A doorman helps with bags. -The windows are double-pane and effective, but don't block all noise. And there's always something happening in the square. Protests, marches, performances, etc. Also, the twice-daily ceremony of soldiers marching out with music to raise the flag at 8 and lower it at 6. During the day, buskers perform below the rooms facing the side street. Taking it all in added to my experience. But if you need absolute silence, this isn't it. -The general location isn't ideal for Ubering to other parts of the city. Rides are cheap -- usually $4 to $6 to Polanco or Roma. But getting in and out of the narrow, one-way streets of the Centro can add a fair bit of time to the journey.",2019,5,1

588,Where should i start. The hotel's history alone holds its own weight. First elevator ever installed in Mexico! The panoramic glass cathedral ceiling which easily resembles anything in Europe is a masterpiece. I'm a New Yorker who recently moved to Socal. I've also lived in Europe on & off. This hotel can rival any place I've been to. Most importantly the staff. I had issues that they did not hesitate to fix at all. No questions asked. Highly recommended to any American or European tourists looking for a great hotel. PS The Terrace restaurant has the best views i. Tje city,2019,5,1

The room was amazing, the meals on the terrace are very good.

There is champagne out in the lobby at all times and was a welcomed refreshment after a long day of walking around and touring. I would stay at the Gran Hotel again when returning to CDMX!",2018,11,1

750,"A beautiful historic hotel centrally located right on the Zocalo. Staff accommodating and friendly.Room was extremely spacious, clean, with a great view of the square.Very quiet and heavy curtains available to make the room totally dark for sleeping in. Some nice touches at check-in; complimentary champagne, a personalized plate of pastries in the room. The only downside were the dining options in the hotel. The breakfast buffet seemed a bit tired and the terrace restaurant lacking. We opted instead for a couple of excellent meals within walking distance. The entrance to the hotel is a bit funky, as the main doorway is not on the Zocalo, but on a pedestrian only side street. When we were dropped off by taxi from the airport, it was on the corner about 20 meters from the actual entrance. There is a driveway in the parking garage that accesses another entry, but cab drivers don't seem to know how to get in there. Not a big deal, just a bit awkward. For a big hotel it was quiet, comfortable, and serene. We felt secure and the staff knew us by name when we returned a few weeks later at the end of our trip. Overall positive experience. We'll be back on our next trip to CDMX.",2018,9,1

757,It's a historic hotel in an excellent location. Only problem was I was a little cold and couldn't find a way to warm the room. Only stayed for one night so didn't bother to ask about this - maybe there's an easy solution.,2018,8,1
758,"This hotel is one of a kind, it has a peculiar sense of royalty permeated in it; every wall, every floor and every roof clearly speak of such magnificence. It is a true architectural gem from the past still shining... Everything we experienced here was pleasant and unforgettable. My wife just couldn't stop taking pictures... We arranged our airport pickup through their liaised transportation services and couldn't be more satisfied....they made our short journey efficient and safe. I wish we could have stayed longer....so much to see here... Next time!",2018,8,1
759,"- Service overall was friendly and attentive. - The building itself is a beautiful historical landmark, with a spectacular atrium. - Dining in both the ground floor breakfast buffet and the 4th-floor open-air terrace restaurant were excellent - Hard not to like complimentary champagne available 24/7 at the front desk! - At check- in we were immediately assigned (upgraded?) to a grandiose 3rd-floor corner room with a magnificent view over the Zocalo. - The one-day commercial tour to Taxco that the hotel recommended and subsequently booked for us turned out to be very poor and disappointing ... not the town but the tour company. - One night we were unable to sleep because of very loud hammering going on somewhere near and above our room from 12:00midnight to past 3:00am. Finally I called the front desk and complained. They first suggested moving us to another room for the night. I replied that the only proper solution was for the noise to stop. They finally admitted some work was going on and had it stopped so there was no more noise. They also apologized and gave us a voucher for 2 free dinners on the 4th floor the next day. - One electric window shade in our room went up on its own in the middle of the night several nights in a row. - Our room’s electronically-coded safe did not work with any number we entered. 3 times a security guard had to come open it manually. - The hotel’s $US exchange rate was the best in the area. - We WOULD stay again.",2018,8,1

902,居間と寝室が別々のスイート型。広々として家具調度もクオリティが高い。寝室には４隅に柱のあるカーテンで囲われたベッド。洗面所も広々と快適。観光にも食事にも申し分ない立地。受付は良くも悪しくもいかにも五つ星（当サイトでは四つ星となっているが実際には五つ星だったかと）。値段はリーズナブル。但し最上階のレストランには少々失望。スタッフは多いのだがサービスが遅い。客に対してアテンティブとも思えない。黙っていても普通に出てくるトルティーヤチップスとサルサも言わなきゃ持ってこなかったし、ビールが終わる頃になってもまだ前菜のサラダが出なくてこれも催促する羽目に。ワインリスト頼んだらウェイトレスは同僚と喋りながらこちらに顔も向けずポイと置いていった（あのマナー）。料理も値段の割にいまいち。というわけでレストランのサービスが減点。それ以外はまあ快適。,2018,2,1

I wonder why he had to ask only me. lol... he actually saw me before that morning... anyhow... also, they were doing some work next to our room... it was noisy when we came back from breakfast and doing some shopping, we just wanted to lay down for a bit before we checked out... but the whole experience was great!!.... I would totally come back to stay at this hotel!!!...",2017,12,1

963,Very comfortable bed. - Not hard as is usually a problem for me. No bad smell or traffic noise in my room on fourth floor. Close to shopping and several museums. Daytime feel secure and no need for taxi if you only have a couple of days and never visited Mexico city before. It was actually only 19 minutes with taxi to airport at 7 a.m. on a monday morning. And I agreed to pay 150 pesos with taxi on the street next to hotel. One of the more beautiful and spacious room and hotel I stayed in. I would however have appreciated a gym with more weights and equipment since there is no pool which can not be expected in centre of Mexico City. I would really have appreciated if they installed a sauna. Then I would definitely not consider other hotel on later occasion.,2017,10,1
